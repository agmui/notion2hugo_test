```cpp
struct my_struct {
    /* data */
};
```

Think of structs like a class that is all data no methods. kinda like Java data classes

[when to use structs or classes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c)

## EX:

```cpp
struct person {
	char* name;
	int age;
	float height;
};

int main(){
    char name[5] = "asdf";
	struct person p = {name,1,2}; // initialize a struct
    printf("%s\n", p.name);
}
```

### Other ways to initialize structs

```cpp
struct person p;

char name[5] = "asdf";
p.name = name;
p.age = 1;
p.height = 2;
```

## struct pointer syntax

```cpp
int main(){
    char name[5] = "asdf";
    
	struct person p = {name,0,0};
	struct person* p_ptr = &p;
	printf("%s\n", p_ptr->p);
}
```

<details>
      <summary>Note:</summary>
      We use the `->` arrow syntax like in classes when struct is a pointer because all a class is is just a struct with some methods bundled in. This is the reason why places like java and python use `this` and `self`. They can be thought of as structs.
