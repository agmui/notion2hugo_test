The CLI class can be conneted to the serial monitor and have commands
sent to it via the usb cable. This is so you can “peek” at any value or
inter state such as the motor position or write simple tests to run on
the pico. To do this can just add your own commands with this [add demo](about:blank#adding-cli-cmd).
