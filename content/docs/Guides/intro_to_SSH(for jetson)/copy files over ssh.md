If you want to send files from your laptop to the computer you ssh into run the `scp` (Secure Copy) command:

```bash
scp <ip>:<from> <to>
# or 
scp <from> <ip>:<to>
```

### example:

```bash
# currently on ssh sever
# my computer -> ssh server
scp john@192.168.69.69:~/file.txt ~/my_folder/
```

```bash
# currently on my computer
# ssh server -> my computer
scp admin@192.168.69.420:~/file.txt ~/my_folder/
```
